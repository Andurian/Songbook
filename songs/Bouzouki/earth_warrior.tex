This is my home, it's where I belong

I see the Sun in the sky , make me feel so high
I see the full moon shine, make me feel so fine

Her river my blood, Her rock my bone
Her earth my muscle Her heart my soul
Her children my children, their freedom my goal
I'll be fighting fighting fighting fighting fighting for them all!

\beginverse
People breed disassociation
Industrial nation of elimination
a million mutant monkeys making mutilation
deforestation from nation to nation
~\\
the Earth and her children, no they cannot hide
from pollution, confusion and genocide
but I will protect them, yes I got the right
'cause I am a Soldier, I fight the good fight!
