\beginsong{Back Home in Derry}[
	by={Traditional}]

\beginverse
In \[Am]eighteen-o-three we \[Em]sailed out to sea
\[G]Out from the \[D]sweet town of \[Am]Derry
\[Am]For Australia bound, if we \[Em]didn't all drown
The \[G]marks of our \[D]fetters we \[Am]carried

\[Am]In our rusty iron chains we \[Em]cried for our weans
Our \[Am]good women we left in \[Em]sorrow
As the \[Am]main sails unfurled, our \[Em]curses we hurled
On the \[G]English and \[D]thoughts of \[Am]tomorrow
\endverse

\beginverse
At the ^mouth of the Foyle, bade ^farewell to the soil
As ^down below ^decks we were ^lying
O'^Doherty screamed, woken ^out of a dream
By a ^vision of ^bold Robert ^dying

The ^sun burnt cruel as we ^dished out the gruel
Dan O'^Conner was down with a ^fever
Sixty ^rebels today, bound for ^Botany Bay
How ^many will ^reach their re^ceiver
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Oh oh oh \[D]oh oh I \[Am]wish I was \[D]back home in \[Am]Derry
\[G]Oh oh oh \[D]oh oh I \[Am]wish I was \[D]back home in \[Am]Derry
\endchorus

\beginverse
I ^cursed them to hell as our ^bow fought the swell
Our ^ship danced like a ^moth in the ^firelight
White ^horses rode high as the ^devil passed by
Taking ^souls to ^Hades by ^twilight

Five ^weeks out to sea, we were ^now forty-three
We ^buried our comrades each ^morning
In ^our own slime we were ^lost in the time
^Endless ^night without ^dawning
\endverse

\beginverse
^Van Diemen's Land is a ^hell for a man
To ^end out his ^whole life in ^slavery
Where the ^climate is raw and a ^gun makes the law
Neither ^wind nor ^rain care for ^bravery

Twenty ^years have gone by, I have ^ended my bond
My ^comrades' ghosts walk ^beside me
A ^rebel I came, I ^am still the same
On the ^cold winds of ^night you will ^find me
\endverse

\beginverse*
\[G]Oh oh oh \[D]oh oh I \[Am]wish I was \[D]back home in \[Am]Derry
