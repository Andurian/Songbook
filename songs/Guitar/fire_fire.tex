\beginverse\memorize[fire_fire_verse]
\[Am]Hope I can make it, Stop it and break it
The \[C]doors are all locked down
I'm \[F]flying on my feet
gotta \[G]reach that corridor
\vspace{1em}
\[Am]Sirens are blaring, screams from the staring
\[C]as they watch him cry
He's \[F]holding on as he's ripped from the room
en\[G]gulfed in flames, but they'll be out soon
\endverse

\beginverse*\memorize[fire_fire_bridge]
\[G]Oh it's such a \[F]shame, 
of all the \[Am]things to go wrong while \[G]out in space
\endverse

\beginchorus\memorize[fire_fire_chorus]
\[F]Fire, fire \[C]burns much brighter when \[Am]oxygen \[Em]is the supplier
\[F]Fire, fire is \[C]killing his desire to \[Am]not be cold \[Em]as he expires
\[C]Oh, burning in \[G]space
\[Am]Oh, burning in \[Em]space
\endchorus

\beginverse\replay[fire_fire_verse]
I ^wake from the cold sweat, how could I forget
I've ^seen this all before
The ^red lights are spinning now
^'round and 'round as I hit ground
\vspace{1em}
^Warnings of pure dread heard on the overhead
^in a monotonic tone
^There are men and women trapped in that room
^flames scorching them, but they'll be out soon
\endverse
