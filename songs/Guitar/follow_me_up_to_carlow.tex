	by={Traditional}]
	
\beginverse\memorize
\[Dm]Lift MacCahir \[C]Og your face
You're \[Dm]brooding o'er you're \[C]old disgrace
That \[Dm]black FitzWilliam \[C]stormed your place,
He \[Dm]sent you \[Am]to the \[Dm]Fern.
\[Dm]Grey said victo\[C]ry was sure
\[Dm]Soon the firebrand \[C]he'd secure;
\[Dm]Until he met at \[C]Glenmalure
With \[Dm]Fiach Mac\[Am]Hugh O'\[Dm]Byrne.
\endverse 

\beginchorus
\[Am]Curse and swear Lord Kildare,
\[C]Fiach will do what Fiach will dare
\[Am]Now FitzWilliam, have a care
\[C]Fallen \[Am]is your star, \[Dm]low.
\[Am]Up with halberd out with sword
\[C]On we'll go for by the lord
\[Am]Fiach MacHugh has given the word,
\[C]Follow me \[Am]up to Car\[Dm]low.
\endchorus

\beginverse
^See the swords of ^Glen Imayle,
They ^flash all o'er the ^English pale,
See ^all the children ^of the Gael,
Be^neath O'^Byrne's ^banners
^Rooster of the ^fighting stock,
^Would you let a ^Saxon cock
Crow ^out upon an ^Irish rock?
^Fly up and ^teach him ^manners.
\endverse

\beginverse
^From Tassagart ^to Clonmore,
There ^flows a stream of ^Saxon gore
Oh, ^great is Rory ^Oge O'More,
At ^sending ^loons to ^Hades.
^White is sick and ^Grey is fled,
And ^now for black Fitz^William's head
We'll ^send it over, ^dripping red,
To Queen ^Liza ^and her ^ladies.
\endverse
