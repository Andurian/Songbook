\beginsong{Lady in Black}[]
\beginverse\memorize
She \[Em]came to me one morning,
one \[Em]lonely Sunday morning
Her \[D]long hair flowing,
in the \[Em]midwinter wind

I \[Em]know not how she found me,
for in \[Em]darkness I was walking
And \[D]destruction lay around me,
from a \[Em]fight I could not win
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Em]Ah ah ah ah ah \[D]ah ah ah \[Em]ah
\[G]Ah ah ah \[D]ah ah ah \[Em]ah
\endchorus

\beginverse
She ^asked me name my foe then,
I ^said the need within some men
To ^fight and kill their brothers,
without ^thought of love or God
      
And I ^begged her (to) give me horses,
to ^trample down my enemies
So ^eager was my passion,
to ^devour this waste of life
\endverse

\beginverse
But she ^wouldn't think of battle that
re^duces men to animals
So ^easy to begin,
and yet im^possible to end.
    
For ^she's the mother of our men,
who ^counseled me so wisely then
I ^feared to walk alone again,
and ^asked if she would stay
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh, ^lady lend your hand outright,
and ^let me rest here at your side
Have ^faith and trust in peace she said,
and ^filled my heart with life

There ^is no strength in numbers,
have ^no such misconception
But ^when you need me,
be assured I ^won't be far away
\endverse

\beginverse
Thus ^having spoke she turned away,
and ^though I found no words to say
I ^stood and watched until I saw,
her ^black coat disappear
   
My ^labor is no easier,
but ^now I know I m not alone
I ^find new heart each time,
I think up^on that windy day

And \[Em]if one day she comes to you,
drink \[Em]deeply from her words so wise
Take \[D]courage from her as your prize,
and \[Em]say hello from me
\endverse
