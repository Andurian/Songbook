\beginverse\memorize
The \[Em]castle is lit with \[Bm]candles and torches
The \[G]carriages of the nobles arrive in the \[D]front
The \[Am]smell of \[Bm]splendor and \[C]decade\[D]nce
And \[Em]nobody can fore\[Bm]see
\endverse

\beginverse
The ^masters and the mistresses are ^walking to the hall
They are ^smiling, laughing and ^showing that they are tall 
^They don't recog^nize that we're ^waiting the^re
And just ^nobody can fore^see
\vspace*{1em}
This is the last night of the kings
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Am]We are the \[Em]folk and \[Am]we have the \[Em]right
To stand \[Am]up and to \[G]fight for an \[C]independent \[D]life
\[Am]We are the \[Em]force, \[Am]we are the m\[Em]ight
And \[Am]we will stand \[G]up for an \[C]independent \[Em]life
\endchorus

Raban\[Em]da  Raban\[Bm]dabaya \[G]Aaa\[D]ah
Raban\[G]da  Raban\[C]dabaya \[D]Rabadanba\[Em]yah
\endverse

\beginverse
The ^ball has begun and we're ^closing our trap
^Inwardly we're gathering our^selves
^While the ^dance comes to a ^higher pa^ce
Still nobody can foresee
\endverse

\beginverse
^Joining the circles, in ^black robes unknown
Un^sheathing our swords and get ^ready to dance
Our ^hearts are ^filled with the ^will to sur^vive
In this \[Em]last night of their \[B7]life
\vspace*{1em}
It's a \[G]murderous, \[D]murderous ball \[Em]night
