\beginverse
As \[Am]I walked out on a \[G]bright May morn'
To \[F]take a pleasant \[C]walk
\[F]I sat \[C]down on an \[G]old stone wall
To \[Am]hear two \[G]lovers \[Am]talk
\vspace{1em}
To \[Am]hear what they might \[G]say, my dear
To \[F]hear what they might \[C]say
So \[F]I might \[C]learn a \[G]little about love
Be\[Am]fore I \[G]go a\[Am]way
\endverse

^Come sit beside me, ^dear.
To^gether on the ^green.
It's been a ^long three ^quarters of a ^year or more
Since to^gether ^we have ^been.

Since to^gether we have ^been my dear,
Since ^together we have ^been.
It's been a ^long three ^quarters of a ^year or more 
since to^gether ^we have ^been.

\[Am]"P" stands for \[G]Paddy, I suppose
