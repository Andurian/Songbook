\[Dm]Sunset, \[Am]Moonrise \[Dm]--- And see \[G]how the land is \[Dm]bathed

You \[Dm]feel so \[Am]lonely \[Dm]--- Come with \[G]me and let me \[Dm]show
There are \[Am]others just like \[Dm]you

Who \[F]feel the \[C]powers of \[Am]Earth, Sea and \[Dm]Sky
Of \[F]Dragons and \[C]Faerie and \[Am]Shades of the \[Dm]night
Hear the \[F]call of our \[C]ancestors of blood and \[G]bone
Of womb and tomb, and standing \[A]stone...

\[Dm]Lady stir your \[F]Cauldron \[G]well
\[G]Chant your words and \[C]sing your \[Dm]spell

You're \[G]Ceridwen's Children
The \[Am]Cauldron \[Dm]Born!

Your ^life a ^construction one day you will ^see
Through the illusion and into the ^dream!
