As I was \[Em]walking \[D]all a\[Em]lone

\[Em]Where shall we \[C]go and \[D]dine to\[Em]day-o?
\[Em]Where shall we \[C]go and \[D]dine to\[Em]day?
\endverse

\beginverse
Out be^yond that ^old high ^dike
I know there ^lies a ^murdered ^knight
And no-one ^knows that he lies ^there-o
But his ^hawk and his ^hound and his ^lady ^fair-o
His ^hawk and his ^hound and his ^lady ^fair
\endverse

\beginverse
His hound is ^to the ^hunting ^gone
His hawk to ^fetch the ^wild bird ^home
His lady ^loves another ^knight-o
So ^we may ^make our ^dinner ^sweet-o
So ^we may ^make our ^dinner ^sweet
\endverse

\beginverse
So you may ^sit on ^his white ^thigh
And I'll peck ^out his ^bonny blue ^eyes
And with a ^lock of his golden ^hair-o
We'll ^fix our ^nest when ^it grows ^bare-o
We'll ^fix our ^nest when ^it grows ^bare
\endverse

\beginverse
There's many a ^one for ^him does ^moan
But noone ^knows where ^he is ^gone
And o'er his ^bones when they lie ^bare-o
The ^wind will ^blow for^ever ^more-o
The ^wind will ^blow for^ever ^more
