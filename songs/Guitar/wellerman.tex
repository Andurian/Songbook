\beginsong{Wellerman}[
	by={New Zealand Traditional}]
	
\beginverse\memorize
There \[Am]once was a ship that \[Am]put to sea
The \[Dm]name of the ship was the \[Am]Billy of Tea
The \[Am]winds blew up, her \[Am]bow dipped down
\[E]Blow, me bully boys, \[Am]blow, huh!
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]Soon may the \[C]Wellerman come
To \[Dm]bring us sugar and \[Am]tea and rum
\[F]One day, when the \[C]tonguin' is done,
Weâ€™ll \[E]take our leave and \[Am]go
\endchorus

\beginverse
She ^had not been two ^weeks from shore
When ^down on her a ^right whale bore
The ^captain called all ^hands and swore
He'd ^take that whale in ^tow, huh!
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus without words.}

\beginverse
Be^fore the boat had ^hit the water
The ^wha-le's tail came ^up and caught her
All ^hands to the side, har^pooned and fought her
^When she dived down ^low
\endverse

\beginverse
No ^line was cut, no ^whale was freed
The ^captain's mind was ^not of greed
And ^he belonged to the ^whaleman's creed
She ^took that ship in ^tow
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus without words.}

\beginverse
For ^forty days, or ^even more
The ^line went slack, then ^tight once more
All ^boats were lost (there were ^only four)
But ^still that whale did ^go
\endverse

\beginverse
As ^far as I've heard, the ^fight's still on
The ^line's not cut and the ^whale's not gone
The ^Wellerman makes his ^regular call
To en\[Dm]courage the Captain, \[Am]crew, and all
\endverse

\textnote{Repeat Chorus while fading Guitar out.}
