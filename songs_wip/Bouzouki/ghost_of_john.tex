\beginsong{Ghost of John}[]

\beginverse
Have you heard of the Ghost of John?
Long, white bones and the rest all gone!
Oooooooh!
Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?
\endverse

\beginverse
John belongs in a quaint nightmare.
Wobbly jaw and a hollow glare!
Oooooooh!
Wouldn't things look murky through sockets bare?
\endverse

\beginverse
John is gone from feet to skull.
Pointy elbows and clavicle!
Oooooooh!
Wouldn't it be harsh to hug John's fossil?
\endverse

\beginverse
John's not sad; he has had his day.
Smile that's fixed in a rigid way!
Oooooooh!
Wouldn't frowning be hard when lips decay?
\endverse

\beginverse
John once said, "I've lost my head!"
Empty thoughts top his spine instead.
Oooooooh!
Isn't it the truth now that he is dead?
\endverse
