\beginsong{Scarborough Fair / The Elven Lover}[]
\beginverse
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
Remember me to a girl who lives there
if she would be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
between the sea and silver sand
If she would be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to plough it with a dandelion thorn
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
and sow the field with spirits unborn
If she would be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
and gather it all in flowers of heather
If she would be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to weave it on Unicorn bone
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
and dye it red with the blood of old stone
If she would be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to make me a funeral shirt
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
with stitches all of graveyard earth
If she would be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to find me where the banshee sings
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
and fly to me on angelwings
then she will be a true love of mine...
\endverse
